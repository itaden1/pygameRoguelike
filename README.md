# Pygame Roguelike

This repo was created as a legacy/reminder of where my programming journy began. Its horribly messy, badly written, incomplete, and works (kind of...). I am also proud of it (kind of...)

When I began to code this game I barely new what a variable was and it serves as a reminder of how far I have come.
